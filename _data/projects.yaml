  description: Spatially and temporally resolved atomic hydrogen densities are quantified using two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence (TALIF) at the plasma–biofuel interface. The measurements provide absolute H-atom number densities and fluxes directly relevant to plasma-assisted biofuel hydrogenation kinetics.
