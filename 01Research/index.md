### Thrust 1: Controlling Interfacial Plasmas for Chemical Manufacturing and Up-Cycling

Interactions of plasmas at multiphase boundaries (e.g., gas-liquid, gas-solid, gas-liquid-solid) have broad
implications in semiconductor, agriculture, and energy. We aim to develope innovative non-equilibrium platforms for scalable two-dimensional chemical manufacturing at low thermal budget with arbitrary substrates.

Supported by Princeton Collaborative Low Temperature Plasma Research Facility (PCRF).

### Thrust 2: Developing Advanced Laser Diagnostics for Manufacturing, SmartAg, Energy, and Environment

In situ laser diagnostics in the mid-infrared region, which contains the fundamental vibrational signatures of most molecules, are essential for tracking the chemical dynamics of radicals, excited states, and molecular intermediates that drive efficient combustion, advanced manufacturing, heterogeneous catalysis, and agricultural/environmental chemistry. We aim to develop advanced laser diagnostic capabilities to probe elementary kinetics, optimize surface processes, advance value-added manufacturing from agricultural feedstocks, and detect atmospheric trace gases.

Supported by Michigan State University Shared Research Infrastructure Program (SRIP).
